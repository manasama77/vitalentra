<h1>Sugar is often a source of comfort — but also a source of problems.</h1>

<p>We add it to our morning coffee, afternoon snacks, and evening desserts. Unfortunately, excessive sugar consumption
    can have negative effects on health.</p>

<p>Facts show that too much sugar contributes to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even premature skin aging.
    That’s why more people are looking for healthier, sweet, and safe alternatives for daily consumption. One of the
    best choices? <strong>Stevia</strong>.</p>

<h2>What Is Stevia?</h2>

<p>Stevia is a natural sweetener derived from the leaves of the <em>Stevia rebaudiana</em> plant, which has long been
    used by South American communities to sweeten tea and traditional herbal drinks. Today, stevia is known as a
    zero-calorie natural sweetener that is 200–300 times sweeter than sugar, without the negative effects.</p>

        <strong>Zero Calories, Zero Guilt</strong><br>
        One teaspoon of sugar contains about 16 calories. Stevia? Zero. If you’re watching your weight or reducing daily
        calorie intake, stevia is the solution to enjoy sweetness without guilt.
        <em>Tip: Try replacing sugar with a few drops of Steffi (liquid stevia) in your favorite coffee or tea. It
            tastes great, and keeps you healthy!</em>

        <strong>Safe for Blood Sugar</strong><br>
        Sugar causes dangerous spikes in blood sugar, especially for people with diabetes or insulin resistance.
        Research shows that stevia does not raise blood sugar or insulin levels, making it safe for daily use.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Supports Heart Health</strong><br>
        Too much sugar can increase blood pressure and blood fat levels — major risk factors for heart disease. Reducing
        sugar and switching to stevia helps lower these risks and keeps your energy stable throughout the day.

    <li>
        <strong>Gentler on Teeth</strong><br>
        Sugar feeds mouth bacteria that cause cavities. Stevia does not harm teeth or promote bacterial growth, making
        it an ideal choice for children and families.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Natural and Safe for Daily Use</strong><br>
        Stevia is not an artificial sweetener. It comes from nature, is free of chemicals, and has been approved by
        health authorities like the FDA and WHO. In reasonable amounts, stevia is safe for daily use as a sugar
        substitute.
