    We all love sweet things. From our favorite drinks to daily snacks. But did you know that consuming regular sugar
    (sucrose) in the long term can bring serious health consequences?
</p>

<p>
    Here are some negative effects of excessive sugar consumption that are often overlooked:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Increases Risk of Type 2 Diabetes</strong><br>
        The habit of consuming high-sugar foods and drinks causes spikes in blood sugar levels. If this continues to
        happen, the body can develop insulin resistance which leads to type 2 diabetes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Burdens the Heart and Blood Vessels</strong><br>
        Excess sugar can trigger high blood pressure, inflammation, and increased bad cholesterol (LDL) â€” all risk
        factors for heart disease.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Triggers Weight Gain and Obesity</strong><br>
        Sugar contains high calories but minimal nutrients. In large amounts, it can make the body store excess fat,
        especially in the abdominal area.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Affects Brain Function and Mood</strong><br>
        Sugar can give a quick effect like a "happy boost", but it's also followed by a crash that makes you quickly
        tired, easily irritated, and difficult to focus.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Damages Dental and Skin Health</strong><br>
        Sugar feeds bacteria that cause tooth decay. Additionally, excess sugar in the blood can trigger acne and
        premature aging of the skin.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Starting now, reduce regular sugar consumption and choose natural sweeteners like <strong>Steffi</strong> which are
    safer for the long term. Your body will thank you in the future!
